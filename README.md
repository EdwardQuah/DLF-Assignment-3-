This paper highlights the usage of RNNs in predicting stock price data.
A recurrent neural network (RNN)suits times series data due to its architecture, but falls short when spatial dependencies come into play. This research highlights the architectural design 
of an RNN and how its advanced variants: Long Short Term memory and Gated Recurrent Units improves on the baseline RNN and can effectively capture long term spatial dependencies.
